            <div class="p-style">
              During the months I was there, I had many opportunities to create commercial posters for Eyexpo’s many events. These include poster in an oversea contest, flyers at the night markets, and coming soon posters of their new upcoming apps.
              In addition to promotional posters, I was also tasked with updating and creating new graphic assets for their official website with the front-end web designer.
              For each graphic design project, I worked closely with the design team lead and the advertising manager in creating and tweaking the design to reflect the company’s image.
              Each project also had its unique constraints. For example, the contest poster would not let me use any text and had a very wide cut-off borders while the night market flyers had a lot of content but a very tiny space to work with. Since I could only use commercial and royalty free images or create assets from scratch, there was a lot of difficulties but was overall incredibly experimental and educational.

        <h2 class="head-2 step">Social Media Banners</h2>
        <div class="p-style">
          For each of their client who requested a customized VR production, a promotional social media banner would be created. If possible, official VR shots taken during production were used to accurately present the project, but if none were found suitable, commercial royalty-free images were edited and photoshopped. Over the course of 5 months, I’ve designed 20+ banners that are up on their official website, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

        <h2 class="head-2 step">3D in Unity VR</h2>
        <div class="p-style">
          As Eyexpo expands on their VR capabilities, I was tasked with creating some quick environment of their office using Sketchup and their floor plans. As Sketchup can render an environment into 360 panoramic images, I modeled the office, placed furniture from the Sketchup 3D warehouse, and set up cameras around the environment to create a mock-up VR experience. Once normal images from the camera were exported, I rendered the images in Photoshop and added scale people to emulate an architectural rendering that can be used for future promotions.
          The environment models I made (which includes the office and a convention building) were later exported into FBX and imported into Unity VR. There was the problem where some furniture’s UVs were flipped during importing, which had to be imported into Maya to be fixed.

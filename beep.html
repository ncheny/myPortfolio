            <div class="p-style">
              Beep's concept started in my sketchbook as a 3D platformer where player traverse through three different planets with their own unique enemy types and boss. I designed a wide variety of enemies, boss types, enemy interactions, environment, heiroglyph collection system, character stages, enemies type,  color palette, and lighting concept art.
              <br> <br>
              The fist world was designed to be comprised of cubes, the second world would have spikes, and the third world would be filled with triangles. Enemies in each world would reflect on the environment shapes. Similarly, player learns how to morph in the first world and would learn special attack skills as they move on to the next planet.
              <br> <br>
              Since the cube planet was the most fleshed out and due to time constraint, it was the only planet that was built.

              My role in creating and texturing the models were focused on the design of the spaceship and the second enemy type found in later level of the game. While I explored different design of the spaceship models in Maya, the form of the trapezoid enemy was set pretty early on with wome minor changes in the body ratio. Textures of the trapezoid enemy was created in Clip Studio and then compiled in Unity3D.

            <h2 class="head-2 step">Camera Research</h2>
            <div class="p-style">
               Camera was researched by me through several iterations. Initially, it was planned to be a dynamically positioned camera where its position will change depending on user position. However, it quickly proved to be dizzying and would clip through tall objects. Thus, I implemented a transparency toggle on taller objects, but as it was time-consuming to set up on each tall object, I started researching silhouette shaders that were similar to those used in <a class="inline-link" href="https://vltmn.itch.io/lieve-oma">Lieve Oma</a>. This was initially done via the use of ambient occlusion. Other dynamic camera implementations were tested, but as our camera research was nearing the deadline, user controlled camera was chosen- which was first built with horizontal control then both axis enabled.

            <div class="p-style">
               As our world were asset heavy, there was noticeable lag between levels. Thus, I researched for tutorials online to implement a fading transition between levels. After that, I was responsible for the menu UI where heiroglyphs and game settings would be stored. While the feature was scrapped from the final iteration, I created a particle effect on interactive cubes that would turn on only when they are in camera view.

            <h2 class="head-2 step">Sound, Waves & World Building</h2>
            <div class="p-style">
              Sound was collected from <a class="inline-link" href="https://freesound.org/">freesounds.org</a> and <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music">Youtube Sound Library</a>. As this was my first time integrating sound into a 3D environment, the process took longer than expected. Nearly all of the sound in the game, from the ambient water streaming to the BGM and the beeping of our main character over random interval was desgined and selected to create a consistent sound palette. Many of the sound had to be triggered by code, like gate opening and puzzle activations, which required me to communicate closely with our coder.
              <br><br>
              Water physic came at the latest part of the development so I had to look for one that would fit our game's semi-flat aesthetic with limited time. Through some research, I found a few wave prefabs provided in Unity's Standard Assets, played around with it, and was able to create a customized version in a relatively short time.
              <br><br>
              Once that was done, I had to set up the intro screen and the tutorial map. Introduction screen was planned so that once user press start, player would see a UFO crashing onto a planet where our avatar would emerge into the tutorial level. I designed and coded the stage to have in-world tuturials popping up with control tips. The control tips were later adopted into other levels as well.
